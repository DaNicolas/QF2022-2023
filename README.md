# Lecture material for course "Quadratic forms and class fields II"
Course taught at Charles University in Spring 2023.

Here I will post lecture notes which accompany the lectures.
They contain a summary of the material covered during the lectures, as well as additional exercises which can be done to help with the study of the material.
Any feedback is appreciated.

## Instructions for compilation
Download the files `Lecture-notes.tex` and `bibliography.bib`.
Compile `Lecture-notes.tex` first with `PdfLaTeX`, then with `biber`, then once more with `PdfLaTeX`.
Only standard LaTeX packages were used.
